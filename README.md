# 🧠 Agentic AI Cybersecurity Agent
**An AI-powered autonomous threat-hunting model built in Python for next-generation SOC automation.**

---

## 🔍 Overview
The **Agentic AI Cybersecurity Agent** is an advanced AI model designed to autonomously hunt, analyze, and respond to security threats across enterprise-scale infrastructures.  
Built using **GitHub Copilot Pro** and developed in **Python**, this project integrates directly with **Microsoft Sentinel** and **Defender for Endpoint** via secure API connections to a **Cyber Range** cloud environment ingesting telemetry from over **1,000 endpoints and servers**.

Powered by **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**, the agent processes massive log datasets to detect Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) **300–500 times faster than a human analyst**.  
When anomalies or threats are confirmed, it can simulate or recommend isolation of affected systems—with human oversight required to validate findings and approve remediation.

## 🧩 Security Guardrails & Enhancements
This model incorporates a comprehensive set of AI security guardrails and resilience mechanisms, including:

- 🔐 **Password-protected isolation & remediation guardrails**  
- 🧹 **PII redaction and data sanitization**  
- 📏 **Row/Byte cap rate enforcement**  
- ⏱️ **Time-window input restrictions**  
- 🧰 **Robust error handling and validation logic**

In addition, the agent is being expanded with:
- 🛡️ **OWASP LLM Top 10 Hardening**  
- 🗺️ **MITRE ATLAS threat-mapping**  

These enhancements align AI reasoning with adversarial behavior models, creating a **powerful, defensible framework for AI-driven cybersecurity automation**.

## 🚀 Project Vision
This repository serves as the **central hub** for a modular, agentic AI platform focused on autonomous threat detection, reasoning, and mitigation.  
Each submodule expands the agent’s core capabilities, with future plans including:

- Integration of **explainability layers** (trace-based reasoning)  
- **Threat context enrichment** using Azure OpenAI  
- Full **containerized orchestration** for scalable simulation  
- **Human-in-the-loop validation interface** for SOC operators
