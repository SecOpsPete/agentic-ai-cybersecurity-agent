# üß† Agentic AI Cybersecurity Agent
**An AI-powered autonomous threat-hunting model built in Python for next-generation SOC automation.**

---

## üîç Overview
The **Agentic AI Cybersecurity Agent** is an advanced AI model designed to autonomously hunt, analyze, and respond to security threats across enterprise-scale infrastructures.  <br>

Base model built in The Cyber Range classroom labs, customizations added with assistance from  **GitHub Copilot Pro** and developed in **Python**, this project integrates directly with **Microsoft Sentinel** and **Defender for Endpoint** via secure API connections to a **Cyber Range** cloud environment ingesting telemetry from over **1,000 endpoints and servers**.

Powered by **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**, the agent processes massive log datasets to detect Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) **300‚Äì500 times faster than a human analyst**.  <br>

When anomalies or threats are confirmed, it can simulate or recommend isolation of affected systems‚Äîwith human oversight required to validate findings and approve remediation.

## üß© Security, Guardrails & Enhancements
This model incorporates a comprehensive set of AI security guardrails and resilience mechanisms, including:

- üîê **Password-protected isolation & remediation guardrails**  
- üßπ **PII redaction and data sanitization**  
- üìè **Row/Byte cap rate enforcement**  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time-window input restrictions**  
- üß∞ **Robust error handling and validation logic**

In addition, the agent is being expanded with:
- üõ°Ô∏è **OWASP LLM Top 10 Hardening**  
- üó∫Ô∏è **MITRE ATLAS threat-mapping**  

These enhancements align AI reasoning with adversarial behavior models, creating a **powerful, defensible framework for AI-driven cybersecurity automation**.
